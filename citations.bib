  abstract  = {The emergence of large-scale quantum computing presents an imminent threat to contemporary public-key cryptosystems, with quantum algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm capable of efficiently breaking RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). This vulnerability has catalyzed accelerated standardization efforts for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and global security stakeholders. While theoretical security analysis of these quantum-resistant algorithms has advanced considerably, comprehensive real-world performance benchmarks spanning diverse computing environments—from high-performance cloud infrastructure to severely resource-constrained IoT devices—remain insufficient for informed deployment planning. This paper presents the most extensive cross-platform empirical evaluation to date of NIST-selected PQC algorithms, including CRYSTALS-Kyber and NTRU for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), alongside BIKE as a code-based alternative, and CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon for digital signatures. Our systematic benchmarking framework measures computational latency, memory utilization, key sizes, and protocol overhead across multiple security levels (NIST Levels 1, 3, and 5) in three distinct hardware environments and various network conditions. Results demonstrate that contemporary server architectures can implement these algorithms with negligible performance impact (<5% additional latency), making immediate adoption feasible for cloud services. In contrast, resource-constrained devices experience more significant overhead, with computational demands varying by up to 12× between algorithms at equivalent security levels, highlighting the importance of algorithm selection for edge deployments. Beyond standalone algorithm performance, we analyze integration challenges within existing security protocols, revealing that naive implementation of PQC in TLS 1.3 can increase handshake size by up to 7× compared to classical approaches. To address this, we propose and evaluate three optimization strategies that reduce bandwidth requirements by 40–60% without compromising security guarantees. Our investigation further encompasses memory-constrained implementation techniques, side-channel resistance measures, and hybrid classical-quantum approaches for transitional deployments. Based on these comprehensive findings, we present a risk-based migration framework and algorithm selection guidelines tailored to specific use cases, including financial transactions, secure firmware updates, vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, and IoT fleet management. This practical roadmap enables organizations to strategically prioritize systems for quantum-resistant upgrades based on data sensitivity, resource constraints, and technical feasibility. Our results conclusively demonstrate that PQC is deployment-ready for most applications, provided that implementations are carefully optimized for the specific performance characteristics and security requirements of target environments. We also identify several remaining research challenges for the community, including further optimization for ultra-constrained devices, standardization of hybrid schemes, and hardware acceleration opportunities.}

abstract = {Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as GapSVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a natural extension of the “learning from parity with error” problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for GapSVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical (i.e., nonquantum).We also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystem whose security is based on the hardness of the learning problem. By the main result, its security is also based on the worst-case quantum hardness of GapSVP and SIVP. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous lattice-based cryptosystems: the public key is of size \~{O}(n2) and encrypting a message increases its size by a factor of \~{O}(n) (in previous cryptosystems these values are \~{O}(n4) and \~{O}(n2), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length \~{O}(n2), the size of the public key can be reduced to \~{O}(n).},

In particular, our ID scheme has communication complexity of around 65,000 bits and the length of the signatures produced by our signature scheme is about 50,000 bits. All prior lattice-based identification schemes required on the order of millions of bits to be transferred, while all previous lattice-based signature schemes were either stateful, too inefficient, or produced signatures whose lengths were also on the order of millions of bits. The security of our identification scheme is based on the hardness of finding the approximate shortest vector to within a factor of {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(n^2){\$}in the standard model, while the security of the signature scheme is based on the same assumption in the random oracle model.

abstract = {The advent of quantum computing threatens the security of traditional public-key cryptography. Algorithms for quantum computing have the ability to solve the large prime factorization and the discrete logarithm problem in polynomial time. To deal with the threat, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) primitives and protocols were proposed. Lattice-based cryptography (LBC) is the promising post-quantum cryptography, both in traditional and emerging security scenarios such as public-key encryption, homomorphic encryption and oblivious transfer. Theoretically, the algebraic structure of the lattice provides a secure fundamental for LBC. In contrast, the implementation should consider the balance of time, space, and resources for realization on various programmable platforms. In the implementation of lattice-based cryptography, polynomial multiplication is the primary operation accounting for about 30% of the execution. To improve the performance of LBC schemes, various efficient algorithms have been proposed over decades. This work focuses on approaches to accelerate polynomial multiplication used in LBC schemes. First, we review and compare three polynomial multiplication algorithms, Number Theory Transform (NTT), Karatsuba algorithm and Toom–Cook algorithm. Then we present a comprehensive survey of implementation on programmable platforms such as Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). At last, we summarize the future trend of implementing polynomial multiplication and provide recommendations.}
